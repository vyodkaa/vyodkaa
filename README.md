hello there, im vyodka, ure probably reading this because u clicked on me on ponytown, i assume. (there's no way someone would look at my profile otherwise) i usually hangout in pony town at the CH area, and sometimes at the left side of the library.

im a bit nervous to talk to people first but, if you want to talk to me first go ahead! don't be afraid to open up to me, i tolerate every ship. im an ISTP-T.

some of my likings are:
- countryhumans (obviously)
- pjsk (specifically VBS)
- link click 
- mo dao zu shi
- jet fighters
- instant noodles

my hobbies:
- drawing
- listening to music
- making AUs
- writing
- playing
- sleep

please do not interact with me if u:
- are homophobic, racist, etc. (the usual criteria)
- want to talk about nsfw, gore, or any other disturbing stuff.
- want to argue with me

  other than those, its totally fine to talk to me!

please know, i only like russia/ussr and america for their people and their culture (and because of countryhumans), not the government. i do not support them in any way in political matters.

i do like talking about history and war, i also like military stuff, and i like aviation. 

please int if:
- u have common likings!
- u ship:
  RusAme/SovAme, GerPol, or FrUK
- u tolerate my ships
- u have ocs and have AUS related to countryhumans

I also play other games, which are blood strike, minecraft, and war thunder.

thats all for now, thank you!
